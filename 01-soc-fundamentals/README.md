# 🛡️ SOC Fundamentals

## 📌 Overview
This module introduced the structure, technologies, and responsibilities within a Security Operations Center (SOC).

---

## 🏢 Introduction to SOC
A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized team responsible for monitoring, detecting, analyzing, and responding to security incidents in real time.

The main goal of a SOC is to protect organizational assets through continuous monitoring and structured incident response.

---

## 🏗️ SOC Types and Roles
Different SOC models exist depending on the organization:

- In-house SOC  
- Outsourced SOC (MSSP)  
- Hybrid SOC  

### 👨‍💻 Analyst Roles
- Tier 1 (Triage Analyst)  
- Tier 2 (Incident Investigator)  
- Tier 3 (Threat Hunter / Senior Analyst)  

Each tier has increasing responsibility and technical depth.

---

## 🎯 SOC Analyst Responsibilities
A SOC Analyst is responsible for:

- Monitoring alerts  
- Investigating suspicious activity  
- Identifying false positives  
- Escalating confirmed incidents  
- Documenting investigations  

Documentation is critical in maintaining visibility and accountability.

---

## 📊 SIEM and Analyst Relationship
SIEM platforms collect and correlate logs from multiple sources.

SOC analysts rely on SIEM to:

- Detect anomalies  
- Investigate alerts  
- Perform log searches  
- Identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)  

SIEM is the core tool for daily SOC operations.

---

## 📂 Log Management
Logs provide visibility into:

- Authentication attempts  
- Network traffic  
- Endpoint behavior  
- Application activity  

Proper log collection and retention are essential for effective investigation.

---

## 🖥️ EDR – Endpoint Detection and Response
EDR tools monitor endpoint behavior to detect malicious activity.

They provide:

- Process monitoring  
- File activity tracking  
- Behavioral detection  
- Isolation capabilities  

EDR complements SIEM investigations.

---

## ⚙️ SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response)
SOAR platforms automate repetitive security tasks.

They help:

- Reduce response time  
- Standardize workflows  
- Improve efficiency  

Automation reduces analyst fatigue.

---

## 🌍 Threat Intelligence Feed
Threat Intelligence provides:

- Malicious IP addresses  
- Malicious domains  
- Malware hashes  
- Known attack patterns  

Analysts use threat intelligence to validate and enrich investigations.

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes Made by SOC Analysts
Common beginner mistakes include:

- Closing alerts too quickly  
- Ignoring context  
- Poor documentation  
- Not validating indicators  
- Failing to correlate multiple logs  

Avoiding these mistakes improves investigation quality.
